## Summary  
From Key Account Manager to AI Solution Engineer—my career has stayed in the middle.  
I used to translate executive worries about risk, timelines, and ROI into proposals and demos.  
Now I translate the same worries into working software: prompts, RAG pipelines, guardrails, and adoption workshops that make AI **useful, safe, and sustainable**.  
Same seat at the table, same listening — but instead of pitching the bridge, I spend my days building it alongside customers, partners, and engineers until it’s live.

## Work Experience

### **LightOn — AI Solution Engineer**  
*Feb 2025 – Present | Paris (On-site) | Remote engagements with clients in Japan, UAE, Germany, Spain*  
Technical ownership for 3 active POCs, 4 strategic customers (direct enterprise clients), and 2 key partners (resellers).

- **End-to-End POC Leadership**: Define success criteria, validate RAG accuracy & adoption, tune system prompts, implement custom guardrails (PII masking, refusal policies), and de-risk go-live via usage telemetry and stakeholder alignment.
- **Solution Enablement & Productization**:  
  - Built **Secure Internal Portal** (`portail.lighton.ai`) — Google SSO, with three role-based tabs:  
    - **CSM**: usage reporting (LightOn API), project tracking (Notion), best practices.  
    - **Presales**: **RAG-powered internal chatbot** (LightOn API + RAG on internal docs), infrastructure docs (Google Drive API), RFP automation (LightOn API + RAG on docs → CSV via Google Sheets API).  
    - **Sales**: pricing lookup (Google Sheets API), battle card generator (Claude API), success stories, slide decks (Google Drive API).  
  - **Built API Demo Kit (Flask)** — 13 reusable, vertical-specific use cases (HR, Legal, Procurement, Support), ephemeral processing, and ROI estimator for new ideas.  
  - Created **Chrome Extension** (Oct 2025) — embeds secure LLM access directly in-browser, eliminating tab-switch friction.
- **Deployment & Customization**: Configure instances per customer/POC: proprietary LLMs & embedders, auth keys, rate limits, UI translations (EN/FR/AR).
- **User & Admin Enablement**:  
  - Train **admins** to independently debug RAG outputs (query → retrieved chunks → model behavior), reducing tier-1 support dependency by **~30%**.  
  - Deliver and **co-design tailored workshops** with customers (e.g., HR teams using real job descriptions; Legal teams analyzing contracts) — accelerating team-level adoption and surfacing high-impact use cases early.  
  - **Mentor junior SEs**: Onboarded and coached 2 new Solution Engineers — from shadowing to independent POC ownership — until fully ramped and client-ready.
- **Prototyping at Scale**: **Processed 250M+ Claude tokens in October 2025 alone** to build and validate:  
  - *NDA Analyzer* (clause-level risk + historical negotiation check)  
  - *Book Recommender* (persona generation + RAG over corpus)  
  - *Visual RAG* (ID/contract analysis), *CSV/Table extraction*, *Multi-doc comparison*  
- **Documentation & Adoption**: Launched **“Use Cases” tab** in official product docs (Mintlify) — examples, schemas, and reusable code adopted by customers/partners for self-serve implementation.
- **Strategic Collaboration & Alignment**:  
  - **Product Strategy**: Established a near-daily feedback loop to identify usability gaps, directly influencing the roadmap for features like the Chrome extension and CSV analysis.  
  - **Sales Engineering**: Partnered weekly with Sales to design custom demos, review architectures, and provide technical backing for pipeline progression.  
  - **Enterprise Account Success**: Led weekly operational reviews and co-design workshops with strategic direct clients to drive adoption, track usage metrics, and expand use cases.  
  - **Partner Enablement**: Managed weekly GTM alignment for resellers, including demo certification, battle card training, and readiness checks to ensure channel success.  
  - **POC Validation**: Facilitated bi-weekly technical sprints with POC teams to validate solutions and iterate on performance.  
  - **Support Enablement**: Collaborated weekly on root-cause analysis and knowledge transfer to enhance Tier-1 troubleshooting capabilities.  
  - **Cross-Functional Stakeholder Alignment**: Regularly engaged with diverse client departments — including RSSI, DSI, Legal, HR, infra/ops, and data scientists — at all levels, from engineers to the C-suite.

### **CEGID — Key Account Manager**  
*2021 – Nov 2024 | Paris*  
Managed a portfolio of ~250 Mid-Market clients in HR, payroll, and finance SaaS.

- Drove end-to-end sales cycles — from opportunity identification (chart-of-accounts analysis, client prospecting, events, network) to ROI modeling, negotiation, and signature.  
- **Pioneered a 3-hour interactive demo format**: Guided prospects to *act as end-users* of the platform — hands-on configuration, data input, and scenario testing — significantly increasing engagement and deal acceleration by deepening buy-in through direct experience.  
- Orchestrated cross-client collaboration initiatives and post-sale deployment follow-up.  
- Navigated complex transformations triggered by regulatory shifts (e.g., pension reform), technology adoption, and process reengineering.

**Results**:  
- **2023**: €572K bookings (104% of €550K target) | €103K collaboration (103% of €100K)  
- **2022**: €476K bookings (126% of €378K target) | €83K collaboration (104% of €80K)  
- **2021**: Transitioned to a new team and manager to launch a new project — achieved target exceedance within 6 months.

### **SIMCO — Business Developer**  
*2019 | Paris*  
Prospected and closed SaaS solutions for local municipalities and Public Intercommunal Cooperation Establishments (EPCI).

- Targeted decision-makers: Mayors, CFOs, Finance Officials, and General Services Directors via cold outreach and follow-up.  
- Owned full sales cycle: needs assessment, product demos, quoting, and closing.  

**Result**: €45K achieved vs. €35K target (**+29%**).

### **INFOTEL — Business Developer (Internship)**  
*2017 | Paris*  
Supported public-sector framework agreement execution across 6 sequential markets.

- Analyzed tender requirements and client needs.  
- Sourced and vetted consultants (direct hire & subcontractors).  
- Drafted compliant proposals and managed staff-augmentation missions (activity reports, progress tracking).  
- Contributed to successful renewal of the client’s public market contract (multi-year framework).
